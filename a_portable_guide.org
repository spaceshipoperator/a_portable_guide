* a portable guide
  “a portable guide” is fundamentally a set of principles which yields an approach to solving problems: 

  - transparency
  - accountability
  - adaptability
  - simplicity
  - reproducibility

  These attributes are intended to represent a concise and ordered set of principles. They are the result of careful consideration and scrutiny of the contributors to this guide.

  With deliberate adherence to the established principles, when approaching any challenge, the following (similarly concise and ordered) characteristics are defined which correspond to each of the afformentioned principles.

  - declaration
  - foundation
  - considerations
  - resources
  - implementation

  Our principles yield our approach to solving problems, and if we are successful, the solutions we produce will reflect our principles.
